# ADR-003: Implement Asynchronous Order Processing

Status: Proposed
Scope: Domain



## Context
Our order processing system currently handles all operations synchronously within a single HTTP request. During peak hours (Black Friday, flash sales), we're seeing 8-12 second response times and a 15% order failure rate due to timeouts.

The order flow involves: payment verification, inventory reservation, shipping calculation, tax computation, fraud detection, email notifications, and analytics tracking. Each of these steps can take 500ms-2s, and any failure causes the entire order to fail.

## Decision
We will transition to an asynchronous, event-driven order processing architecture using Apache Kafka as our message broker.

The order submission endpoint will immediately return a 202 Accepted status with an order ID after basic validation. The order will then be published to a Kafka topic where downstream processors handle payment, inventory, shipping, and notifications independently.

## Consequences
Positive: Order submission response time drops to under 200ms. System can handle 10x current peak load. Individual component failures don't cause total order failure. We can retry failed steps independently.

Negative: Customers no longer receive immediate order confirmation. We need to build order status tracking UI. Debugging becomes more complex due to distributed processing. Eventually consistent system requires careful handling of race conditions.
